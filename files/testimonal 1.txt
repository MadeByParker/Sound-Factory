Mr Shelton has helped me loads within my music journey from performing to production and the business side of music. We met at around half way through my music GCSE and thereâ€™s no way I would have been able to accomplish the grade I did or have the hard working attitude I did towards music without his support. Is a very knowledgeable guitarist and can teach you a lot of new skills to get you playing better immediately. A side from that any instrument/production software used Mr Shelton will be able to help you better yourself as he did for me during my composition. Very friendly attitude towards students making it very easy to learn and concentrate. Could not recommend anymore
