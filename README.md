## About Sound Factory

Sound Factory is a dynamic company that empowers musicians at all skill levels through its three distinctive divisions: Sound Factory Live, Sound Factory Studio, and Sound Factory School. The latter 2 sectors are set to launch in 2024.

Sound Factory Live is currently collaborating with emerging and established artists who aspire to engage in two exciting opportunities: Sound Factory Live Promotions events and Sound Factory Live Sessions.

In the Live Sessions, they record, mix, film, and edit live performances, preparing them for public consumption through various social media platforms. These creative endeavors are orchestrated by seasoned videographers who have honed their craft at renowned establishments such as Abbey Road Studios, Sony, and BBC live sessions. The live sound experience is carefully engineered and mixed by a team boasting a rich history of engineering and producing iconic albums for artists like Oasis, Stone Roses, The Verve, Supergrass, Robert Plant, Muse, and many other celebrated acts.
