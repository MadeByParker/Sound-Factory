                <h3 class="text-box">Luke Riley</h3>
                <p class="text-box">Music Pracitioner and Artist Development Coordinator</p>
                <p class="description">Luke graduated with a degree in Songwriting from the University of Sussex propelling him into Brightons music scene. Here he took on Artist Development work whilst continuing to stay active as a touring musician. He has written music that has seen festival stages, radio, and television, as well as recording in some of the most prestigious and historic recording studios the UK has to offer. Luke specializes in lyric writing and artist development, and has years of experience playing guitar and singing. </p>
    
                <p class="description">During his time in the music industry, Luke has run music nights across many different venues, working with different artists and engineers. His time in studios have seen Luke work alongside some of the best producers in the industry, and this has shed light on the mixing process that Luke is now very familiar with. Luke continues to stay active as a performer, and is in the process of writing and recording his debut album after years of working as a frontman in former bands; all of which honing his knowledge of the industry.</p>
              
                <p class="description">Luke has also worked as a music technician in a mainstream secondary school, giving him an insight into music education and the various needs and demands schools face. Since then, Luke has developed a passion for education, and is currently in the process of applying for a PGCE. Since joining the Sound Factory team at our launch, Luke’s drive and desire to develop all three sectors have influenced growth and productivity in every area. All attributes and skills listed, alongside the creative mind Luke poses, highlights our team’s ability here at Sound Factory.</p>
