                    <h3>Jake Galvin</h3>
                    <h5>Sound Factory Live Video Producer / Editor</h5>
                    <p class="text-box">Jakeâ€™s journey began by following his dad locally in the music scene where he
                        experienced watching him perform in studios, festivals and gigs as a bassist. He was inspired
                        enough to begin playing drums at a young age and eventually turned his hand to playing Bass at
                        the age of 12. Around the same time, Jake had his first experience in a recording studio, and
                        filmed some of his first live sessions on his dads camera. This is where his love for capturing
                        the energy and action started. </p>

                    <p class="text-box">At 14 Jake started gigging regularly and by the time he reached the age of 19,
                        Jake was touring the UK and Europe with Cosmo Jarvis. Throughout his time on tour, Jake racked
                        up tones of experience filming tour videos and studio diaries. Realising the importance of these
                        captured moments and with his passion for filming continuing to grow, Jake went on to study TV
                        and Video Production at the University of Southampton. By third year he was taking on paid
                        freelance work on a regular basis for local bands and the university itself. This also led to
                        Jake filming at the infamous Abbey Road Studios. </p>


                    <p class="text-box">When returning to Plymouth, Jake started his own video and content making
                        company, GalVID. Here, Jake filmed live sessions, live performances, studio diaries and later
                        full music videos. As an experienced musician (around 1000 gigs to date) Jake's skills syncing
                        footage to audio, or paying attention to various aspects of a band/artist and what they are
                        playing, proved crucial in his success with GalVID. This success has led Jake to film work for
                        BBC and major labels such as Sony. </p>

                    <p class="text-box">In 2015 Jake also joined other musicians to form a music studio; Dark Matter
                        Studios. From here, Jake filmed many live sessions and filmed work in other studios such as
                        Momentum Studios, Middle Farm Studios and the historic and legendary Sawmills Studios. At the
                        same time as all of this, Jake has continued his work as a Bass player across many bands,
                        continuing to tour the likes of Europe and the UK extensively and gather recognition from the
                        likes of Bass Guitar Magazine.

                        From his vast experience and knowledge in both film and music, Jake is a crucial member of the
                        team here at Sound Factory. His work ethic, creative mind and passion is something of a rarity
                        within the industry and is one of the factors that means Jake fits perfectly with the ethos of
                        Sound Factory.</p>
