                        <h2>George Shelton</h2>
                        <p>CEO (Studio Producer)</p>
                        <p class="description">Building on a passion for music and a career expanding over more than a decade in education, George has taken on a variety of roles within primary and secondary schools working within mainstream and special schools. From running music therapeutic interventions, to qualifying and teaching as a secondary school music teacher, George has delivered music lessons taking on various styles and group sizes. From winning music awards, mentoring bands on to win competitions, to mixing and mastering their music, George has experience in many fields.</p>

                        <p class="description">He has taken on artist development work outside of education working at the Barbican Theatre, with musicians performing at The Milleniums Awakening nights, and has spent years playing in touring indie rock/pop bands. Songs he has written have seen both TV and Radio play, as well as BBC sessions and festival stages across the UK. He has a wide range of knowledge from working with some of the UK’s best producers and engineers and has recorded in some of the most historic and prestigious studios around.</p>

                        
                        <p class="description">Whilst working within education, George noticed a lack in other music school’s focus on skill acquisition and song writing. He also knew the importance and excitement that studio time offered and so this was incorporated into Sound Factory Music School’s process. His passion for creating young artists and giving young people the skills to express themselves through music is something that kick started Sound Factory into providing a music school. As someone who grew up as a ‘Pupil Premium’ student, George is also passionate about giving back to those who can’t afford music tuition and therefore created a scheme that involves all students across all backgrounds.</p>

                            <p>Associate Director of Sound Production & Engineering</p>
                            <p class="description">John Cornfield has produced and engineered some of the biggest names in music - Muse, Oasis, Robert Plant, Supergrass, Stone Roses, The Verve and many more. You name them, he’s worked with them, mostly at the legendary Sawmills Studio in Cornwall.</p>
    
                            <p class="description">In his early years, production legend John Cornfield started out doing sound and lighting at school and went on to an engineering apprenticeship where he picked up some valuable mechanical and electronic skills. He then spent time fixing things for bands, including equipment, lighting rigs and even vans whilst on the road. After working closely with one of the many Hawkwind drummers, Martin Griffin, John was put in touch with Dennis Smith and Simon Fraser at the prestigious Sawmills Studio where he became an assistant engineer working with the likes of John Leckie (Engineer/Tape operator for artists such as: Pink Floyd, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrsion) before setting out on the freelance path leading him to produce now-classic albums for the likes of Oasis, Robert Plant, Muse, New Model Army, Supergrass, Verve, The Stone Roses and many more. John still prefers the energy of musicians playing together:
                            “I am into recording bands as bands and prefer capturing the live energy that a band produces when they are on it”.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p class="description">From decades working in the music industry and across dozens of studios up and down the country, John brings with him an abundance of experience and knowledge that few could match. John is an integral part of the Sound Factory team, advising us on the best recording equipment available and informing us of best practice when mixing and mastering the music we record. Our studio will be heavily influenced by John’s guidance over time, so that we can give clients and students the best experience and mixes possible.</p>

                            <p class="description">Luke has also worked as a music technician in a mainstream secondary school, giving him an insight into music education and the various needs and demands schools face.
